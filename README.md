# C++ Beginner Algorithms

## 1. Hello World
Make a file that prints "Hello World" called `HelloWorld.cpp`.

Compile the code into source code (code the computer can read) using `g++ HelloWorld.cpp` while at the root of your folder. 

*Note: This is the benefit of using C++. Since C++ code is compiled into machine code before running, it makes it much faster than a non compiled language or "interpreted" language like Python.*

Run the compiled code using `./a.out`.

## Printing trees and stars
Make a file that prints:

and then also prints:

Call the file `TreesAndStars.cpp`.

Again, compile the code by running `g++ TreesAndStars.cpp` from the command line within your folder.

Run the compiled code using `./a.out`.

*Note: This could be done with either a for loop or a while loop*
